.SH NAME
maillogsentinel \- monitors and analyzes mail server authentication logs for intrusion attempts.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B maillogsentinel
[\fB\-\-config\fR \fIconfig_file\fR]
[\fB\-\-setup\fR]
[\fB\-\-report\fR]
[\fB\-\-reset\fR]
[\fB\-\-purge\fR]
[\fB\-\-help\fR]
[\fB\-\-version\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBMailLogSentinel\fR is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and analyze SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) authentication logs from Postfix/Dovecot mail servers. Its primary goal is to detect and report potential intrusion attempts by identifying failed login events. It operates using Python 3 and standard libraries, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into existing server environments.
.P
Key functionalities include parsing SASL logs, incremental processing with offset tracking, handling of rotated and gzipped log files, storing detected attempts in a CSV file, performing reverse DNS lookups (with caching) for source IPs, generating daily email summaries with statistics and CSV attachment, and an interactive setup process.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR \fIconfig_file\fR
Specify the path to the configuration file. Defaults to \fI/etc/maillogsentinel.conf\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-setup\fR
Run the interactive first-time setup wizard. This is used to create the initial configuration file, define paths, and generate Systemd unit templates. Requires root (sudo) privileges. This process is also triggered automatically if the configuration file is not found. During setup, all console output is logged to \fBmaillogsentinel_setup.log\fR in the current working directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-report\fR
Generate and send the daily email summary report based on the data in the CSV file.
.TP
\fB\-\-reset\fR
Archive existing data (CSV, state file, operational log) to a timestamped backup directory in the user's home directory and reset the log processing offset. The next run will process logs from the beginning.
.TP
\fB\-\-purge\fR
Similar to \fB\-\-reset\fR, but intended for a more complete fresh start by archiving all data.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Show a help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show the script's version number and exit.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fI/etc/maillogsentinel.conf\fR
The default configuration file.
.TP
\fI<working_dir>/maillogsentinel.csv\fR
CSV file where detected authentication attempts are stored. \fI<working_dir>\fR is defined in the configuration file.
.TP
\fI<working_dir>/maillogsentinel.log\fR
Operational log file for MailLogSentinel. \fI<working_dir>\fR is defined in the configuration file.
.TP
\fI<state_dir>/state.offset\fR
State file that stores the last processed log offset. \fI<state_dir>\fR is defined in the configuration file.
.TP
\fI./maillogsentinel_setup.log\fR
Log file created in the current working directory when \fB\-\-setup\fR is run, containing the transcript of the setup process.

.SH CONFIGURATION
MailLogSentinel is configured via an INI-style file, typically located at \fB/etc/maillogsentinel.conf\fR. The \fB\-\-setup\fR option is the recommended way to create this file.
.SS "[paths]"
.TP
\fBworking_dir\fR
Directory for CSV output (\fBmaillogsentinel.csv\fR) and the script's operational log (\fBmaillogsentinel.log\fR).
.br
Example: \fI/var/log/maillogsentinel\fR
.TP
\fBstate_dir\fR
Directory for the state file (\fBstate.offset\fR) which tracks the log processing position.
.br
Example: \fI/var/lib/maillogsentinel\fR
.TP
\fBmail_log\fR
Full path to the mail server log file (e.g., Postfix/Dovecot SASL logs).
.br
Example: \fI/var/log/mail.log\fR
.SS "[report]"
.TP
\fBemail\fR
Recipient email address for daily summary reports.
.br
Example: \fIsecurity-alerts@example.com\fR
.SS "[general]"
.TP
\fBlog_level\fR
Logging verbosity for \fBmaillogsentinel.log\fR. Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.
.br
Default: INFO
.SS "[dns_cache]"
.TP
\fBenabled\fR
Enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) DNS reverse lookup caching.
.br
Default: `true`
.TP
\fBsize\fR
Maximum number of DNS entries in the cache.
.br
Default: 128
.TP
\fBttl_seconds\fR
Time-to-live for cached DNS entries, in seconds.
.br
Default: 3600 (1 hour)

.SH PREREQUISITES
.IP "1." 4
Python 3.6 or newer.
.IP "2." 4
An active Postfix/Dovecot mail server generating SASL authentication logs.
.IP "3." 4
A functional local MTA (e.g., Postfix, Sendmail) for sending email reports.
.IP "4." 4
Appropriate permissions:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 2
Read access to mail log files for the operational user.
.IP \(bu 2
Write access to \fIworking_dir\fR and \fIstate_dir\fR for the operational user.
.IP \(bu 2
Root (`sudo`) privileges for the \fB\-\-setup\fR command.
.RE

.SH "EMAIL REPORTS"
.P
Triggered by the \fB\-\-report\fR option, daily email reports include:
.IP \(bu 2
Summary statistics: total failed attempts, top 10 failed authentications (user, IP, hostname), top 10 usernames, and reverse DNS failure summary.
.IP \(bu 2
Overall CSV file size and total line count.
.IP \(bu 2
The full \fBmaillogsentinel.csv\fR file as an attachment.

.SH "AUTOMATED EXECUTION (SYSTEMD)"
.P
The \fB\-\-setup\fR process generates example Systemd unit files:
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmaillogsentinel.service\fR: Runs log extraction.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmaillogsentinel-extract.timer\fR: Schedules log extraction (e.g., hourly).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmaillogsentinel-report.service\fR: Runs email reporting.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmaillogsentinel-report.timer\fR: Schedules email reporting (e.g., daily).
.P
Users must review, customize (especially the `User=` directive and paths), and then deploy these files to \fI/etc/systemd/system/\fR. After deployment, reload Systemd (`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`) and enable/start the timers (`sudo systemctl enable --now maillogsentinel-extract.timer maillogsentinel-report.timer`).

.SH EXAMPLES
.P
1. Run interactive setup (as root):
.EX
sudo maillogsentinel --setup
.EE
.P
2. Process logs using a specific configuration file:
.EX
maillogsentinel --config /opt/custom/maillog.conf
.EE
.P
3. Generate and send the daily email report:
.EX
maillogsentinel --report
.EE
.P
4. Reset log processing state, archiving old data:
.EX
maillogsentinel --reset
.EE

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
\fB0\fR
Successful execution.
.TP
\fB1\fR
An error occurred (e.g., configuration file not found, permission issues, error during setup). Specific error messages are typically printed to stderr or the script's log file.
