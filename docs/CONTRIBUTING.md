Hey there! 👋
Love what you see? Great—you’re welcome to pitch in!

This is a small, no-fuss project, so there are no strict rules or lengthy procedures. Just:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Open a pull request

That’s it.

Got questions or need a hand? Feel free to ping me anywhere--right here, via issue, or smoke signal. 😊

Thanks for stopping by, and happy hacking! ❤️
